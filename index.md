## Welcome to my page!

My name is Chasz Griego (he/him). I have a PhD in Chemical Engineering, and I am a
Science and Engineering Librarian at Carnegie Mellon University. (CMU)

You can learn more about my research and my interests on this site.

## More About Me

As a Science and Engineering Librarian, I serve as the liaison to the departments of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering at CMU.
I first started at the CMU Libraries in June 2022 as an Open Science Postdoctoral Associate, helping the Open Science and Data Collaborations Program improve outreach, teaching, research, and overall program development.
I received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, then a PhD from the University of Pittsburgh.
For my dissertation, I studied computational models that facilitate screening catalyst materials with quantum chemistry simulations.
My professional interests include studying reproducibility in computational research, teaching Python programming for data science, and advocating open science and scientific skepticism.
My personal interests include playing guitar, board games, and listening to comedy podcasts.
